        Some fun facts about bracelets is that It is said that around 7,000 years ago the wearing of jewelry similar to bracelets became common because of ritual and adornment. In studies by archeologists it was found that people donned bracelets proudly in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and China. In the past bracelets came in and out of style as fashion trends fluctuated. Around the 17th century, European women took it upon themselves to bring bracelets back into the ranks of common fashion accessories of the time period. It was common to wear them in the form of several thin bangles and ribbons along their arms. In the 19th century bracelet chains became widely popular again, and the designs usually linked medallions and cameos. During the Victorian Era, charm bracelets made a fun splash, making engraved charms and dangling lockets the latest craze. 
        Some fun facts you probably didnâ€™t know about earrings are: Earrings and the practice of piercing your ears are both incredibly ancient, it goes all the way back to the bible. They were also worn mainly by men, this was because for most of history men were the holders of wealth. Another fun fact is that in the past sailors often wore earrings made of gold in order to pay for a Christian burial in case of a shipwreck, and the hope that his body would wash ashore.
