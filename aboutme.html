    <p>I am from Spainsh Fork Utah, I was born and raised in that area.</p>
    <p>I Graduated from high school last year and this is my second semester here at BYU-Idaho. I am studying Virtual Design and Construsction, because I love to desing and create. I am excited, as well as scared, for the rest of this semester!</p>
    <p>I have many hobbies but some of my favorites are I enjoy spending time with family and friends and playing all sorts of sports.</p>
    <p>There are many things I want to get out of this class this semester, but the top thing is learning how to put together a decent website so if there is a need for one in the future I will have the knowledge. (I also am interested in this).</p>
